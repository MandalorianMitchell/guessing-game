# guessing-game
This is the project for Alchemy Code Lab Week 1 Class 2 - Guessing Game

I have included information about myself in the HTML portion of my Guessing Game that users can read
in order to answer each question.

Questions - Number 1: Was I born in Oregon?
          - Number 2: How many cats do I have?
          - Number 3: Is my favorite color yellow?
          - Number 4: What is my favorite number?
          - Bonus Question: Guess a number between 1 and 50.

I included a button at the top of the page that the user clicks to begin the game, and buttons
that coincide with the questions I have asked.

Once the user answers all questions, there is another button at the bottom of the page that the
user can click to see what their score was!

Further tweaks to my game to make it more user friendly, and styling to make it look not-boring to follow.
So check back for regular updates!
