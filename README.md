<h1>This is the project for Alchemy Code Lab Week 1 Class 2 - Guessing Game</h1>
<br>
<p>I have included information about myself in the HTML portion of my Guessing Game that users can read in order to answer each question.
<br>
<p>Questions -</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number 1: Was I born in Oregon?
      <li>Number 2: How many cats do I have?
      <li>Number 3: Is my favorite color yellow?
      <li>Number 4: What is my favorite number?
      <li>Bonus Question: Guess a number between 1 and 50.
    </ul>
<br>
<p>I have included a button after my About Me section that, when clicked, asks the user for their name, and then prints their name on the webpage. I have also added buttons that coincide with the questions I have asked, and when those are clicked, these buttons will prompt the user with a question. When answered, it will print the user's answer into the webpage in either green or red text (depending on right/wrong answer), and with an image of either a thumbs up or thumbs down (depending on right/wrong answer).</p>
<br>
<p>Once the user answers all questions, there is another button at the bottom of the page that the user can click to see what their score was!</p>
