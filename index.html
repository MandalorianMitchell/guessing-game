      <h1>Welcome to what will soon be my Guessing Game!</h1>
        <p><input type ='button' value='Click here to begin the game!' onClick='beginGame()'></p>
          <br>
        <p>Let me first start out by telling you a little about myself. From there
        I'll ask you a series of questions based off that information.</p>
        <p>And if you happen to get all of those questions right - awesome! You might
        get a high-five, or a cat picture or something.</p>
        <p>So without further ado, <em>Let's get started!!</em></p>
      <h1>About me:</h1>
        <p>Honestly, there's not much to say! I'm 27 years old, and I've pratically lived
          in Oregon my whole life (though I wasn't born here). I've got 2 cats -
          Clementine, who thoroughly enjoys eating plastic. And Chappa, who looks like a cow.
          I spend most of my working days making costumes and replica movie props, my
          favorite color is yellow, and I probably watch The Office more than any other
          human on Earth.</p>
        <p>Other than that, I love the beach, conspiracy theories, large amounts of coffee,
          and going out to eat more than I should.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
        <p>Well, I think that about explains who I am! Hopefully you enjoyed reading about me,
          and I hope you enjoy my guessing game as well!</p>
